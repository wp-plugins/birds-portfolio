## Description ##

Birds Portfolio allows you to create, manage, categorize and publish portfolio items. The plugin comes with some basic built-in templates to show your portfolio in a page where items can be filtered using smooth animations and cool image hover effects. Those templates have been designed to meet the specifications of a theme based on Zurb Foundation 5.

If you need to modify the template files according to your needs, you'll find them in the '/assets/templates/' folder of the plugin.

Easily group your portfolio items using built-in jQuery filterable tabs and display them with the magical isotope layout.
The portfolio is also responsive so it looks great on all devices, big and small.

This plugin is Localization/Internationalization ready and follows WordPress i18n standards.

**This plugin requires PHP 5.4 or higher to function correctly. Contact your webhosting provider or server administrator if you are unsure which version is installed on your web server.**

### Can I use this plugin if my theme is not based on Zurb Foundation 5? ###

You can, but everything that is Foundation 5 related will look weird on frontend, so you'll have to modify the template files.
You'll find them in the '/assets/templates/' folder of the plugin.
